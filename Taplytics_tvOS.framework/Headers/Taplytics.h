#pragma mark - Starting Taplytics

/**
 Start the Taplytics SDK with your api key. the api key can be found in the 'project settings' page. 
 
 On the first launch of your app Taplytics will show your launch image for a maximum of two seconds, this gives Taplytics time 
 to download your experiment's configuration and display the experiment's changes to your users. In subsequent launches of your 
 app Taplytics will use the experiment's configuration from disk, and not show your launch image. If you do not want this behavior, use:
 [Taplytics startTaplyticsAPIKey:@"API_KEY" options:@{@"delayLoad":@0}];
 
 Console Logging: Taplytics will only log to the console in development builds.
 
 Threading: This method should be called from the main thread, will dispatch_sync to the main thread if not.
 
 @param apiKey Your API key
 @param options Taplytics options dictionary, used for testing. Options include:
            - @{@"delayLoad":@4} allows Taplytics to show your app's launch image and load its configuration for a maximum number of seconds
                on app launch, the default for first launch is 4 seconds. This is useful when running code experiments on the first screen
                of your app, this will ensure that your users will get shown a variation on the first launch of your app. Set to @0 for no
                delay.
            - @{@"liveUpdate":@NO} Taplytics will auto-detect an app store build or a development build. But to force production mode use @NO,
                or @YES to force live update mode for testing.
            - @{@"shakeMenu":@NO} To disable the Taplytics development mode shake menu set @NO, only use if you have your own development shake menu.
            - @{@"disable":@[TaplyticsDisableTrackLocation]} To disable any tracking attributes set a @"disable" key with an array of values to disable from
                TaplyticsOptions.h
 @param callback This callback will be triggered once, with a "loaded" bool true when properties have been loaded successfully or false when the "delayLoad" timeout has been reached.

 Run a code block that can be attached to any experiment through the Taplytics website. The code block will either be

 On the first launch of your app the execution will be delayed and will be called asynchronously on the main thread
 once the Taplytics configuration has been loaded, but before the launch image is hidden.
 
 The code block will only be run once, so in testing, when you want to switch between variations you will want to implement
 the TaplyticsDelegate to run your code block again to see the feature enabled. If you don't implement the TaplyticsDelegate
 you will only be able to see the code block run specifically when your device falls into the relevant segmentation.
