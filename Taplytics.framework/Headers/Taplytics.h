 app Taplytics will use the experiment's configuration from disk, and not show your launch image. If you do not want this behavior, use:

                on app launch, the default for first launch is 2 seconds. This is useful when running a code experiments on the first screen 
                of your app, this will ensure that your users will get shown a variation on the first launch of your app. Set to @0 for no
                delay.
            - @{@"liveUpdate":@NO} Taplytics will auto-detect an app store build or a development build. But to force production mode use @NO,
                or @YES to force live update mode for testing.
            - @{@"shakeMenu":@NO} To disable the Taplytics development mode shake menu set @NO, only use if you have your own development shake menu.

/**
 Run a code block that can be attached to any experiment through the Taplytics website. The code block will either be
 run or not run based on the configuration of the experiment through Taplytics.
 
 On the first launch of your app the execution will be delayed and will be called asynchronously on the main thread
 once the Taplytics configuration has been loaded, but before the launch image is hidden.
 
 The code block will only be run once, so in testing, when you want to switch between variations you will want to implement
 the TaplyticsDelegate to run your code block again to see the feature enabled. If you don't implement the TaplyticsDelegate
 you will only be able to see the code block run specifically when your device falls into the relevant segmentation.

 Variation blocks are defined in a NSDictionary with a key of the variation name, and a value of TLExperimentBlock. For Example:
